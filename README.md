## Project of Software Engineering 2 course at Politecnico di Milano
**CodeKataBattle (CKB)** is a new platform that helps students improve their software development skills
by training with peers on code kata. Educators use the platform to challenge students by creating code
kata battles in which teams of students can compete against each other, thus proving (and improving)
their skills.

A code kata battle is a programming exercise in a programming language of choice (e.g.,
Java, Python). The exercise includes a textual description and a software project with build
automation scripts (e.g., a Gradle project in case of Java sources) that contains a set of test cases that
the program must pass, but without the program implementation. 

Students in groups are asked to complete the
project with their code and they are expected to follow
a test-first approach and develop a solution that passes the required tests. Groups deliver their
solution to the platform (by the end of the battle). At the end of the battle, the platform assigns scores
to groups to create a competition rank.

The **Requirements analysis and specification document (RASD)** contains the description of the scenarios,
the use cases that describe them, and the models describing the requirements and specification for the
problem under consideration.

The **Design document (DD)** contains a functional description of the system with the UML diagrams that provide a detail and full analysis of the architecture.
